# The Actual, Modern, Quality Version of what I was trying to do before

"Just write semantic HTML and have it come out in a beautiful, well-structured dark theme." Whereas before my attempts to make a stylesheet that did this resulted in the general-purpose-stylesheet "Shibuya;Simple," this product was... limited. Because I was a CSS noob who hadn't discovered the glory of CSS Grid, Flexbox, media queries, and much more. Making that thing was a good learning experience, but I can't say anyone would find it useful. THIS, HOWEVER... probably isn't too useful to a professional either, but it's at least better than the previous thing. Because now the stylesheet intuitively turns default semantic tags (like <main>) into grids where it makes sense, and it also contains a handful of prebuilt classes that make grids and flex boxes intuitive and painless to set up. Oh, and it also uses media queries to handle everything down to the tiniest of mobile devices while maintaining readability and without clipping. This thing can handle widths of like, 300px, it's quite hardy.

Want to have a box of content take up two thirds of the reading area and have another box to its right that takes up the last third? 
<article class="left-two-c"> [stuff] </article> <article class="right-one-c"> [other stuff] </article>. 
That is the kind of speed I want when quickly making HTML pages.

Just write semantic HTML and have it come out in a beautiful, well-structured dark theme. 

Welcome to...

Shibuya;Classic

(This will be improved as I get better at CSS. Things I'll focus on: making images better, and making the header more customizable)


(Which sounds cooler than the rejected names, "Shibuya;Advanced", "Shibuya;Intermediate", and "Shibuya;Less-Bad")
